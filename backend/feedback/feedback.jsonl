To find the total number of permutations, we can use the formula:\n\nn! / (r1! * r2! * r3! * r4!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of letters (11), and r1, r2, r3, and r4 are the number of repetitions for each letter (4 S's, 4 I's, 2 P's, and 1 M).\n\n11! / (4! * 4! * 2! * 1!) = 11! / (24 * 24 * 2 * 1)\n= 11! / (1152)\n= 39,916,800 / 1152\n= 34,650\n\nSo, the total number of permutations of the word MISSISSIPPI is 34,650.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of permutations where no four \"I\"s come together**\n\nTo find the number of permutations where no four \"I\"s come together, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars.\" We can represent the 4 I's as 4 stars and the remaining 7 letters (M, S, S, S, S, P, P) as 7 bars.

So, we need to divide the result by the number of permutations of the S's and P's.\n\nLet's first calculate the number of permutations of the 7 bars and 4 stars:\n\n11! / (4! * 4! * 2! * 1!) = 11! / (24 * 24 * 2 * 1)\n= 11! / (1152)\n= 39,916,800 / 1152\n= 34,650\n\nNow, we need to divide this result by the number of permutations of the S's and P's:\n\n(4! * 2!) = 24 * 2 = 48\n\nSo, the number of permutations where no four \"I\"s come together is:\n\n34,650 / 48\n= 7,350\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements of MISSISSIPPI**\n\nTo find the number of arrangements of MISSISSIPPI, we need to subtract the number of permutations where no four \"I\"s come together from the total number of permutations:\n\n34,650 - 7,350\n= 27,300\n\nSo, the number of arrangements of MISSISSIPPI is 27,300.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27,300.", "rating": 4, "comments": "Wrong Answer", "improved_response": "Correct answer is 34,650", "feedback_id": "a3cbb869a014a3b0cef955684150a185"}
